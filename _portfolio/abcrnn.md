abcRNN is one of my most successful deeplearning project. I built with a friend for our cs478 class project. 

### Why
**Problem**: New ideas are hard to come by. Musicians occasionally have hard to generating new music. Most musicians need inspiration before composing their own music.

**Goal**: The goal of this app is to help artists to create new music on a specific genre.

### How
- In this work, Our experimentation is conducted using Python utilizing Keras and Tensorflow. The web app is built with tensorflowjs.

### What
- A music generator application aim to help musician gain inspiration on their music production.
